\begin{abstract}
This document works as a documentation for the project of the Data Bases second course of the Computer Engeneering carreer of the Instituto Tecnologico de Costa Rica, the main goal is to achieve a Whiskey company's database following clean code practices and using different databases engines. Its important to maintain the order and the clean work in diagrams, codes and the present document to reach a clean final project.

\section{Introduction}
The whiskey is not a simple drink, there is a culture about it, the Whiskey was born in Ireland and its production spreads rapidly in Scotland. It is a distillate of cereal aged in wooden barrels. The pioneers in distilling it and formalizing the elaboration process were monks, from them it passed to the peasants who installed countless homemade stills.

Even, there are many people who dedicate their lives to whiskey professionally around the world, they know how to find the difference between a good and a bad kind of whiskey.

For the present project, this drink will be taken as the central axis, since the problem presented is that of a meeting of friends where they have agreed to create a web page for all fans of whiskey from Ireland, Scotland and the United States. The complete context will be described in the "Context of the topic" and "Who is it for and why?" sections.

The web page will have different databases to manage all the respective data like employees, inventory, users, products, etc. The full explication of the project architecture will be described in the  "Application Architecture" section and all the databases diagrams will be shown in the "Database Design" section.

The present document will be the documentation for the prevoiusly mentioned project.

Those in charge of this project will be three students of the Computer Engineering career at the Instituto Tecnologico de Costa Rica, each of the students will use technologies such as database engines, cloud environments for databases, a language of specific programming and others, these technologies will be described in the "Used Tools" section.

All the results will be analyzed in the "Results Analysis", "Found Problems" and "What was achieved and what was not?" section where will be described all the important facts of the finished problem.

All the final conclusions of the project will be shown in the "Conclusion" section.

This document will be made and based on the \LaTeX \ tool and environment to achieve a clean and professional view as well as a correct bibliography.



\section{Definition of important concepts}
    \subsection{Databases}
        A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). \cite{b1}
    \subsection{Frontend}
        FrontEnd is responsible for styling the page in such a way that it can present the information in a pleasant way for the user. The person in charge of the FrontEnd must know the user experience techniques to provide a better interaction between the person and the page they visit, and must also have knowledge of Interaction design to place the elements in such a way that the user can locate them. quickly and comfortably. \cite{b2}
    \subsection{Backend}
        BackEnd is the data access layer of a software that is not accessible to the end user. Also, this layer contains all the application logic that handles the data. It should be noted that the data of an application is stored in a database within a server. \cite{b2}
    \subsection{Framework}
        A framework adds extended functionality to a programming language, automates many of the programming patterns to orient them to a certain purpose, providing a structure to the code, improving it and making it more understandable and sustainable, and allows the application to be separated into layers. \cite{b3}

\section{Context of the topic}
Some friends have met in an afternoon and they want to implement a website for all Whiskey fans for the countries of Scotland, the United States and Ireland. They want a 24/7 system, in which the server is always available and any customer can make a purchase or a subscription to the page at any time. They have hired the three members of this project as the company in charge of developing said program.

After numerous meetings to gather requirements, the clients concluded that they want the following functionalities and general restrictions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item English is the common language of the three countries for which the application will work, so everything must be in this language without exception.
    \item The application must be web without exception. The databases must be hosted in the cloud.
    \item Follow "Clean code" practices
    \item The use of a Git repository is completely mandatory
    \item All data entry must be validated at the database level.
    \item Passwords must be encrypted by a database-level preference algorithm.
    \item The project must carry out internal documentation (comments in the code)
    \item Docker can be used.
    \item Databases must be heterogeneous, distributed and have vertical and horizontal fragmentation.
    \item The system logic must be created at the database level.
    \item For each database, the necessary users must be generated.
\end{itemize}


\section{Who is it for and why?}
This project is aimed at people who love whiskey. The target countries are the United States, Scotland and Ireland, therefore, knowing that the English language is the common language, this language will be the target language. The target age ranges from 21 years (Legal age) onwards, since whiskey is an alcoholic beverage, therefore its delivery to minors is prohibited.
